Hi, Iâ€™m Temi Karim ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a graduate in MSc Supply Chain Management and BA Business Management and Iâ€™m keen on entering the field of data and business analytics

Iâ€™m fascinated by the ability to break down complex pieces of data and summarise it into simple, visually understandable formats. It can be exciting discovering information in a way never thought of before and wondering how it can be used to better the world around us. Itâ€™s also a great way to fulfil my curious nature!

Iâ€™m skilled in Excel and Iâ€™m currently self-teaching Python, SQL, and Power BI. The Data Portfolio folder has the projects Iâ€™ve taken on since starting â€“ feel free to take a look ðŸŒ±
